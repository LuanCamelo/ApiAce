        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>

            <ul>
                <li>Information you give us. For example, our service requires you to sign up for an account, and we may ask for personal information, like your name, email address, and payment information.</li>
                <li>Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
            The information we collect is used to provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services, to develop new ones, and to protect our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of our organization unless one of the following circumstances applies:
            <ul>
                <li>With your consent.</li>
                <li>For legal reasons.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
            <ul>
                <li>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</li>
                <li>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes</h2>
        <p>
            Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page.
        </p>
